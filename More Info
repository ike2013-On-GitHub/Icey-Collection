This is a Scratch game that the creator asked me to publish as an HTML file, and you can find the proof here: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/vronzyy/#comments-340328813.

To play the game:

1. Click on the button that says 'Code.'
2. Click 'Download ZIP.'
3. Go to your files, right-click on the ZIP file, and select 'Extract All.'
4. Open the extracted folder, and you'll find two files.
5. Click on the one named 'Icey 1', '2' or '3' to start playing. Enjoy!
